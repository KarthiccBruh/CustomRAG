    "responseText": "To design a machine learning system for predicting customer churn, I would follow a systematic approach. First, I'd gather comprehensive customer data including usage patterns, engagement metrics, support interactions, and billing history. I'd perform extensive feature engineering, creating derived features like average monthly usage, frequency of interactions, and time since last upgrade. For the model, I'd start with logistic regression as a baseline, then progress to more complex models like random forests or gradient boosting machines. Critically, I'd use techniques to handle class imbalance, such as SMOTE or class weighting, since churn datasets are typically skewed. The model would be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, andespecially ROC AUC, with a focus on minimizing false negatives - we want to identify potential churners before they actually leave. I'd implement a periodic retraining pipeline to ensure the model remains accurate as customer behaviors evolve.",
